Hello! In this blog, I will demonstrate how you can use reticulate to get R and Python to talk to each other! I'm also making a histogram of quakes just to show you that R is indeed working well by itself. Let's get started!
```{r}
hist(quakes$depth)
library(reticulate)
yes <- "Drugs are bad"
```


After making some R stuff, I will now use Python to connect the two.
```{python}
no="Mmnkay"
print(r.yes,no)
```
